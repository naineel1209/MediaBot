# MediaBot

Media Bot uses APIs such as Unsplash for finding images and Positionstack for location services. When a user types in a command such as "/image" followed by a keyword, the bot accesses the Unsplash API to locate and display an image related to that keyword. Similarly, when a user types in a command for a specific location followed by a keyword, the bot accesses the Positionstack API to provide a map of that location within Telegram. By using these APIs, Media Bot is able to provide accurate and relevant content to users quickly and efficiently.
